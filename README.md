# Salon Abed

A modern booking and management platform for **Abed Merhi Barbershop**.

Customers can browse services, view shop information, and book an appointment through a simple step-by-step flow (choose a barber ? choose a service ? pick date/time ? enter details).

The platform also includes separate dashboards for:
- **Admins** to manage barbers, services, bookings, working hours, and homepage content (including image sections).
- **Barbers** to manage their own schedule/availability, profile details, and view bookings assigned to them.

This project is built to keep the public website and the management tools in sync, so updates made in the dashboards are reflected in the customer experience.
